# Think Thrive [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1996d30f-f2f7-4e64-aa02-88e9960680bc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fantastic-manatee-697af7/deploys)

Here I am putting an overview of what my project is about. It comes below the name of my project so that others can read what it is about and get more details.

## Get Started <!-- OPTIONAL, but doesn't hurt -->
1. Clone the repo on your local machine. 
1. Copy over all of your Firebase(database) environment variables into the `.env` file and the Open AI key.
2. ![Screenshot from 2024-03-21 21-40-27](https://github.com/frankcampos/think-thrive2/assets/26656478/affae522-21cf-4b5a-bdbc-45502a1c74c1)

1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application, and `author` to  your name.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.


## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
## The Problem
Repeating the same facts does not equate to actual learning. Learning involves a biological change between synapses and neurons. This app will help you understand how to learn using various methods researched in neuroscience.


## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
Users can create new learning paths. On the page, you can:

1. Edit your learning path card
1. Delete your learning path card
1. View your learning path card
1. Only view someone elseâ€™s learning path
1. User will be able to create conceptual and procedural cards.
1. User will be able to add, remove, and create tags on the cards.
1. User will be able to review the card and get feedback from the OpenAI API.
1. User will have access to instructions.
